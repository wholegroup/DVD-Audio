			It's a feeling every music lover knows: the shelves are crammed with disks but there's nothing to listen to. The songs that fit your mood at the moment &#0151; the ones that touch your soul &#0151; are scattered across a dozen different albums. And you're just too lazy to run back and forth to the player swapping disks.<br><br>
			Audio SixPack <b>WILL HELP</b> you to convert your audio CD collection into the DVD-Audio standard <b>WITHOUT QUALITY</b> LOSS. Using Audio SixPack you will be able to write 6 audio CDs &#0151; at the standard 44.1Khz/16bits &#0151; to 1 DVD-audio disk.

		Do you really need the Audio SixPack software? Ask yourself the following questions:
		<ul>
			<li> Do you feel your CD collection takes up too much space?
			<li> Do you like spending time searching for the right CD?
			<li> Is it easy and convenient for you to repeatedly swap disks in the player?
			<li> Are you positive the CD now playing won't be abruptly ending?
			<li> Is loss of quality from the source material acceptable when you are writing your own DVDs?
			<li> Are you sure that the CD-Audio format is the best for storing music?
		</ul>

		If you answered "no" to 3 or more questions, you should think about purchasing Audio SixPack.
