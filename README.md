#About Audio SixPack

Audio SixPack will help you to convert your audio CD collection into the DVD-Audio standard without quality loss. Using Audio SixPack you will be able to write 6 audio CDs — at the standard 44.1Khz/16bits — to 1 DVD-audio disk. 
  
N.B. The software was designed and tested on Windows XP and probably won't run on newer versions of Windows
